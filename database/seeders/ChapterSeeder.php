            In the evening, in the farmers’ market located in the west region of Zhong Hai city, there were numerous noisy pedestrians and vehicles indifferently passing through. Vegetable leaves and dirty water were strewn all over the ground. There was an enormous amount of different fading store signboards, and occasionally there would be some single-colored neon lights lit up. There were workers returning home, children that finished school, elderly buying groceries, and the many different travel-worn passersby, causing the gray dusty sky to seem more and more depressing.
            
            Perhaps within a metropolitan city like this, such a region was the stain that people looked down upon the most, a region they wished never existed.
            
            By a wall next to an intersection, was a man who was leisurely and contentedly doing what others viewed as shameful.
            
            This was a young man covered in oil and grime, selling mutton skewers. He was sporting a white vest, coffee-colored pants, and a pair of stiff blue plastic slippers.
            
            The young man’s hair was messy, but had a rather mature and handsome face, if one took a closer look, one would notice this was a man with backbone. It’s a pity that no matter how he looked, the ladies walking along the street wouldn’t even pay him a glance, because, he was just a mutton skewers seller.
            
            The young man placed the mutton skewers he just cooked to the side. With the hot weather, grilling was easy but selling was hard. 50 cents for two skewers was considered cheap, but after a whole day, he only earned a little over 10 dollars, barely enough to have 2 meals.
            
            However, the young man didn’t seem to be dejected by this, he instead had a relaxed and satisfied expression. He sat down on his stool, looking towards the crowded street, as if such a view was the prettiest scenery.
            
            “Old Li, it’s about time you paid for what you agreed upon 2 days ago!” A high-pitched male voice suddenly appeared from the side.
            
            The 3 approaching males didn’t look above 20 and were dressed like gangsters, with upright hair, silver chains, holey jeans, scraggy faces, and a cigarette in their mouths.
            
            OId Li was a peddler selling deep-fried snacks right beside the young man. Similarly, due to the hot weather he didn’t have much business and was on his seat with a worried expression.
            
            “This…….” Old Li showed a bitter face, “My Young Master, please be patient. With this hot weather, how am I able to pay without any business……”
            
            “Listen here Old Li, don’t take a yard after being given an inch. If it wasn’t for big bro Feng protecting you, this stall of yours would’ve been wrecked long ago.” A henchman said in a threatening, yet flattering way.
            
            The hooligan called big bro Feng seemed extremely pleased, he patted his henchman, and said, “Today’s protection fee, you can choose to pay or you can choose not to pay. I must get the money either way. Otherwise, I will wreck your stall now!” with that said, he picked up a skewer of sausage, took two big bites and threw the remainder on the ground.
            
            Old Li was stuck without a way out and tightly gripped the small stack of notes in his pocket, considering whether or not to spend it like that. The money was meant for his wife to see a doctor, how could he bear to use it as a “present” for these rascals!?
            
            “I’ll pay for him.” The man from the mutton skewers stall suddenly walked over, and fished out a few notes from his pocket, not even amounting to 100 dollars. He handed it over and indifferently said: “This is all I have, Old Li is getting on in years and urgently needs money, you guys should accumulate some good karma.”
            
            The little hoodlum squinted his eyes and laughed, then took the notes and passed it to his henchman behind, “Yang Chen, you want to pretend to be a good person, but you haven’t paid your own protection fee!”
            
            Yang Chen creased his eyebrows, lamenting in his heart about why these fellas were not properly studying at their age. Why be a hoodlum, but as he wasn’t their father, it wasn’t his position to say anything. He also didn’t want to stir up trouble, so he dully said: “Tomorrow, I will pay tomorrow.”
            
            “Good, I’m not an unsympathetic person, everybody should cooperate. I protect your businesses and you pay me money as a matter of fact…… I will come tomorrow to collect then.” After speaking, the little hoodlum and his two henchmen strutted towards other stalls, bringing them grief.
            
            The eyes of Old Li had already reddened, he bitterly looked towards Yang Chen, “Little Yang, why do you trouble yourself? You are always helping me pay those thugs, how can I let this go on….”
            
            “Old Li, don’t say such a thing. When I just arrived and wasn’t used to life here, I probably wouldn’t even have a friend to talk to, if it wasn’t for you. You are my benefactor, and this is my way of repaying you.”
            
            “You kid….. What should I say to you…..” Old Li seemed to understand that he couldn’t convince Yang Chen and could only sigh.
            
            Yang Chen didn’t mind and laughed, it was a dull yet sincere laugh. As if the extortion earlier didn’t affect his mood, “By the way, how is your wife’s illness?”
            
            Old Li’s eyes were filled with gratitude, “It’s all thanks to you for giving me the money to have an operation for my wife. Right now she only needs to go for a few more check-ups, take some medicine and then she’ll be fine.”
            
            “Oh, that’s great! I wish her an early recovery.” Yang Chen satisfyingly nodded.
            
            Old Li gave a bitter laugh, “Little Yang, the money you lent me will definitely be returned, if I’m unable to return everything before I die, my daughter will carry on the debt…… Alas, if it wasn’t for me, that 100,000 dollars of yours can definitely be used to open a nice shop. You wouldn’t need to come here and sell mutton skewers, and wouldn’t need to endure those hoodlum’s torment.”
            
            Yang Chen curled his lips, “I somewhat enjoy such a way of life, selling mutton skewers isn’t bad, it is simple yet able provide enough for meals.”
            
            “You are too……” Old Li was a little depressed as he said, “Little Yang, you are only 23 or 24 years old, other youngsters of your age are either studying in university, or diligently trying to build a career. Right now you don’t even have a girlfriend, are you planning to sell mutton skewers forever? You aren’t worried, but I feel worried as I watch you.”
            
            Seeing Old Li genuinely express worry for himself, Yang Chen unconsciously revealed a slightly bitter expression, it’s not that he was not worried, he just never thought about it at all.
            
            After the night fell, Yang Chen tidied his stall, and pushed the cart back to the crappy apartment he rented.
            
            This was a small apartment that has been around for who knows how many years. The rent for each month was only 100 dollars. It’s only because nobody wanted to live here that it was this cheap. Unlike other people who worried about the house falling apart, Yang Chen decided to move in the moment he saw how cheap it was.
            
            Yang Chen’s house had very simple furnishing, it was mostly second hand goods others dumped away. There was a bed, a cabinet, a chair, and a TV that could only watch some basic channels.
            
            After pushing the small cart into his small house, Yang Chen gazed upon the calendar hanging on the wall. He checked the date, suddenly remembered something, and promptly ran to the toilet.
            
            In less than 5 minutes, he took a cold shower, and got out of the bathroom naked. His skin was a healthy yellow colour, his well-proportioned body wasn’t very conspicuous, but under careful observation, one could perceive a reserved feeling of masculinity.
            
            Walking towards the cabinet beside the bed, Yang Chen scratched his head in distress while looking at the pile of disorderly clothes. He picked out a few and finally put on a yellow shirt, a pair of light linen pants, and wore the same plastic slippers.
            
            After leaving his house, Yang Chen hurried towards the west region’s most prosperous street, which was also the shabby west region’s only respectable street, named “Bar Street”.
            
            The nightlife of feasting and pleasure-seeking was all around, there were colorful skirts, and all sorts of different perfumes. The moment one entered Bar Street, the city’s atmosphere swept through.
            
            Yang Chen didn’t openly stare like some undisguised and unscrupulous young men, and also didn’t secretly peep at the thighs of beautiful ladies on the street that the others were drooling at.
            
            The bar’s neon lit signboard wasn’t considered dazzling, the bar that could only be considered mid-sized contained a mysterious air, brilliantly colored rose shaped lights were decorated on the signboard.
            
            After entering the bar, Yang Chen walked to the side of the counter in a routine manner, and sat at a corner.
            
            “Big bro Chen, you’re here.” The young bartender wearing a vest noticed Yang Chen, and revealed a warm smile. At the same time, he brought out a cup of water, “Big sis Rose has been waiting for you for a long time.”
            
            Yang Chen gave him a smile, then took a sip from the glass, “Big sis Rose isn’t angry right? I returned home a little late, so I arrived late.”
            
            “Not angry, not angry.” Little Zhao smiled, it was as if the few pimples on his round face were smiling at him as well. With an imploring tone he said: “Big bro Chen, when you have time please teach me. What sort of method did you use that you even managed to pick up our big sis Rose? You know, if the people in Zhong Hai who were interested in our boss made a queue, they could queue from the west region till the sea. For so many years I’ve never seen the boss so in love with any other man. Yet today, just the question of whether you’re here yet, had been asked no less than 5 times…….”
            
            “Don’t speak drivel, there’s nothing going on between me and big sis Rose…..” Yang Chen helplessly, and unenthusiastically replied.
            
            Little Zhao had an expression of ‘I won’t believe that even if you kill me’, then sighed, “Geez…… big bro Chen, to be honest, this cold demeanor of yours is too high level, to be able to pick up a world-breaking beauty like our lady boss. Which man wouldn’t stick to her everyday? There’s only you, who comes only once in a while and even lets a beauty wait for you. Otherwise why do people say that things that you cannot obtain are the best? This sentence is suited to be used on women…..”
            
            Right as little Zhao had an expression of a saint at romance and exaggeration, a charming yet dignified and intelligent voice appeared behind him, “Little Zhao, how many more times do you think your pay can get cut?”
            
            As if he was shocked by an electric current, Little Zhao was dumbfounded. Once he returned to his senses, he immediately sidestepped and pretended to mix drinks, as if nothing happened, but the cold sweat on his forehead gave away the fear in his heart.
            
            With an elegant modern qipao, her thighs were vaguely displayed through the slit to the side of her leg which released an arousing sex appeal. In addition her plump breasts, and an exquisite waist matched well with that smooth porcelain-like face that looked like a meticulous piece of art. On her shoulder were strands of light purple hair. This was a young lady with an appearance like she came out from a painting, as she leisurely walked towards Yang Chen.
            
            
            Yang Chen smiled with both his face and eyes, looking right at the lady without a trace of awkwardness, and sincerely said, “Big sis Rose, you’re really pretty, happy birthday.”',

            'content' => 'Chapter 2: Money is Needed to Find a Prostitute

            Hearing the praise, Rose slightly blushed, bit her smooth lips, and with a tone full of remorse she said, “What use is there being pretty? A certain someone seldom comes by, and even when it’s my birthday that person still arrives this late.”
            
            Facing this sweet and charming lady, a tinge of lust welled up in Yang Chen, increasing exponentially due to her mesmerizing eyes looking at him, without any inkling of abhor. However, with a noble heart Yang Chen managed to suppress his wild desires. Restoring his tranquility, he said, “I don’t drink, and I’m also not good at saying words that make ladies happy. Moreover, I set up my stall everyday, and truly don’t have much spare time.”
            
            Rose grudgingly glared at Yang Chen, “Don’t speak such useless words to me. Setting up a stall? What’s good about setting up a crappy lamb skewers stall? Even if you work yourself to death you won’t earn much money, if you really want to make money, come and be my housekeeper. The salary I’ll pay you every month will be 100 times of what you make from selling lamb skewers!”
            
            Yang Chen bitterly laughed and said, “Big sis Rose, men don’t usually become housekeepers.”
            
            “I’ve told you so many times, call me Rose, why are you always calling big sis, big sis, big sis, am I that old?”
            
            Yang Chen could only compromise, “Alright, Rose, I was wrong. It’s just that, I somewhat enjoy my current lifestyle, for the time being I don’t intend to switch jobs.”
            
            Unwilling to give up, Rose said, “You don’t have to be my housekeeper then, being my bodyguard will do right? Or, I could let you be the manager of the bar, I rarely supervise this place anyways, I usually let it be.”
            
            Hearing these words, Yang Chen felt a little touched, of course he knew this woman truly cared for him, but he had his own stance. Since the day he met Rose, he decided not to get too intimate with this woman.
            
            “Forget it Rose, I feel that selling mutton skewers is pretty good, the farmers’ market has quite a number of nice people as well.” Yang Chen lowered his head to drink his water, unwilling to continue on this subject.
            
            Upon seeing Yang Chen’s stubbornness, Rose frowned, then angrily whispered to herself, “It’s only good if you become my man…….”
            
            What she doesn’t didn’t realise was, the words that she said, that she herself could barely hear, were words that Yang Chen clearly heard, but Yang Chen knew that he must pretend that he didn’t hear anything.
            
            No matter how dim the lights in the bar were, Rose’s face and physique still emitted an irresistible charm. However, from the moment Rose appeared, even when some people noticed her, they would only dare to take one glance before looking away. Some curious new customers asked the surrounding patrons who Rose was, and there was basically only one answer—— “Drink your liquor, don’t court death.”
            
            Feeling a little defeated, Rose walked to the other side of the counter, sat beside Yang Chen, first poured a glass of whiskey for herself, then poured another for Yang Chen, rolled her eyes and rebuked, “Old ox, I know you’re tough. It’s fine that you are unwilling to stay by my side, however today’s my birthday, can you make an exception and drink a glass of liquor?”
            
            Yang Chen hesitated for a moment, the truth was, it’s not that he can’t drink, it’s just that every time he drinks, the alcohol would cause disorder to his psyche. There were too many things he didn’t want to recall, which is why he needed to be calm. Therefore, to him, alcohol is poison…….
            
            “Alright, but only one glass.” Harboring a tinge of guilt, Yang Chen is unwilling to utterly disappoint Rose, so he decided to accept. Silently hoping in his heart that nothing will happen, since it’s only a small glass.
            
            Sure enough, Rose happily smiled, that smile resembled seeing snow for the first time. Under the dim light, her visage glowed with luster, entering Yang Chen’s eyes, it made his heart tremble again.
            
            “Cheers.”
            
            After clinking the glasses, Yang Chen raised his head and drank the ice-cold liquid without any hesitation.
            
            Rose made a ‘gege’ laugh, leaned forward, and pressed her body onto Yang Chen’s chest and melancholily said, “Do you know, it has been 10 years since I last celebrated my birthday. Although there’s no cake, no candles, no presents, not even a party…… there is an unromantic man like you to accompany me to a drink, I feel very contented……”
            
            This woman’s physique looked well-developed from any angle and caused men to drool. At this moment, Yang Chen distinctly felt two soft moldable lumps pressing against his thigh, gently stroking it, bringing with it a stimulating sensation.
            
            Slightly lowering his head, he saw the slit of Rose’s qipao, and the fairly discernible soft porcelain-like snowy skin. Below her exquisite ankles was a pair of fiery-red high-heeled shoes,
            
            The intense visual stimulation along with fierce seduction aroused Yang Chen’s male hormones.
            
            When a man meets a woman, among hormones, the adrenal glands hormones’ reaction, is the most straightforward evaluation of the woman. Evidently, Rose scored well in this.
            
            Just as Yang Chen did his best to suppress his body’s reaction, Rose finally stood up, gave him a crafty smile, as if she was a fox who succeeded in her plot, “This is good, my man, seems like your ‘capital’ is outstandingly robust huh……”
            
            Yang Chen forced a smile, of course he knew what Rose was referring to. This woman, she actually peeped on him while she approached earlier.
            
            “I can see that you can barely endure sitting here, I’m going to go entertain my other customers, if you don’t want to stay any longer, you may leave.” Rose left the seat in a natural and unrestrained manner, and walked towards the other customers.
            
            The customers of the bar long ago knew that the bar’s lady boss was very charming, yet they didn’t dare to forgo their manners. This was due to receiving information that the woman’s background wasn’t simple at all. As a result, it was effortless for Rose greet her customers.
            
            As a matter of fact, Rose’s face contained a passionate smile. That extraordinary temperament was enough to cause the majority of men to feel intimidated, thus they could only look on from a distance. Also, they didn’t want to reveal any notions of obscenity, as nobody courted a rebuff.
            
            When Rose left, Yang Chen breathed a sigh of relief, and at the same time he silently mocked himself. For the last half a year that he returned to this country, he seemed to have changed quite a bit.
            
            If it was the Yang Chen of the past, facing a mesmerizing lady like Rose who had affection for him, there wouldn’t even be a need for her to seduce him. He would’ve thrown her onto a bed long ago without a care for whatever the consequences. In any case after the deed was done he could just leave.
            
            However, he can’t do that now, especially to Rose who can be considered one of his first friends in Zhong Hai, and to him, in his heart she was significant.
            
            Although he only drank a small amount, the alcohol had already started affecting his mind. Yang Chen felt that his craving for alcohol had already been awoken, yet he didn’t dare to drink in excess, the pain of recalling unwanted things after drinking is something only he understood.
            
            However, seeing that his lower body still had a pitched tent, Yang Chen felt the need to vent some of his pent-up emotions, otherwise ‘it’ would be stifled to death. But of course, Rose won’t do, once they have that relationship, it would be difficult for him to get away.
            
            After drinking a cup of water, Yang Chen quietly left ROSE bar. When he left, within the eyes of Rose who silently watched him leave, was a sense of disappointment.
            
            Outside the bar, Yang Chen looked around, before finally walking towards a small bar close by. There may be many prey in high-class bars, but the money in Yang Chen’s wallet wouldn’t be enough.',
